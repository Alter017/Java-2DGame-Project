# Java-2DGame-Project
My first 2D RPG Game, completely coded in Java.
I would like to clarify that this code is NOT FULLY CREATED BY ME. I followed a set of tutorials by RyiSnow so I could learn how to code 2D video games in Java. And based on the code he was using for his own game, I changed it and made my own version to develop the code in this project.
It is not yet finished, but I am planning to do so by the end of October 2025 at the latest.
This code is FREE to use for NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. Using it for school projects, personal use, sharing with friends, etc., is perfectly fine.
